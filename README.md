## Known Issues

- As described in [Issue 9](https://github.com/mwakerman/kanbanist/issues/9), the drag-and-drop functionality is visually buggy (offset) and not working at all in Safari.

## Development

Kanbanist is a static (serverless) website built using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and dependencies are managed using [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

To get started `git clone` the repository and then run `yarn` (to install dependencies) and `yarn start` to start the development server.

In case you prefer a more isolated test environment, you can also use Docker or even the more convenient `docker-compose up` to start the development server.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please use the following `prettier` configuration on all javascript files (or run `yarn format`):

```
prettier --print-width 120 ---tab-width 4 -single-quote --jsx-bracket-same-line --arrow-parens avoid --trailing-comma es5 --write src/**/*.js
```
